**Code and tutorial to reproduce the manuscript "Exploring Co-explosive Dynamics: Bitcoin Price, Attractiveness, and Sentiment Variables"**

The aim of this paper is to estimate the determinants of Bitcoin price in the long term considering the gold price, S&P500, Google searches for Bitcoin, and the financial stress index. We use a co-explosive VAR model from Nielsen (2010) and Engsted and Nielsen (2012). Basically, we present the code focused on the main result of the paper which is the relationship between Bitcoin price and Google searches for Bitcoin. We have the following 7 codes below. We use Ox-metrics 9.06 software.
